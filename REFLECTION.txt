What did you like or dislike and why?

i really disliked how we were required to use the gridworld framework.
i understand how learning how to use and understand frameworks is an important skill,
but honestly i could have finished this lab in a fraction of the time with java shapes.

what was surprising or unexpected?

it was really surprising how many errors came up. first there were the arraylists.
thought we had to use arraylists.
apparently arraylists are array with location items inside, and it was .size() instead
of .length().

what did you learn?

well i learned not to procrastinate till the last 3 days. those 3 days were the most
painful i've had in a while.

What questions do you still have?

umm, was there a "correct" way to do this lab? my friends talked about using 2 grids at once,
so you could read all the occupied locations and then update it at once instead of using
arraylists

whate advice would you offer to next year's students?

this lab is super fun but challenging! try to allocate enough time, + extra just in case 
awful errors come up.
